<h1>All Things FX</h1>
<p>Using the https://currencyapi.com/ free api I was able to create a currency exchange converter!</p>
<p>The converter does simple conversions of currencies and outputs CSVs for current exchange rates and historic exchange rates on a simple GUI.</p>
<p>Don't forget to change the file path to the location you desire or an exception will be thrown and you will not get your CSV's</p>
